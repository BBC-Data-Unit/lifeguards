In July 2017 **Alexandra Ma** [reported](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-40493228) that just over half of bathing spots along England's coast have no lifeguards on duty over the summer.

BBC England's data unit analysed a list of beaches patrolled by lifeguards, RNLI and otherwise, using data provided by the RNLI, the Beach Guide and local councils' websites, as of 7 July 2017.

The list was compared to the Department of Environment Food and Rural Affairs' list of designated bathing waters in England, with inland waters - such as Lake Windermere and Hampstead Heath in London - stripped out.
